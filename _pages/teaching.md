I am the Program Manager for the 2-year Master programme [ICT in Business and the Public Sector](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/ict-in-business-and-the-public-sector) at Leiden University.

As part of that programme, I teach the Master course [Managing Software Evolution](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/102446/managing-software-evolution).
